convertNST2MaryTts.pl now splits the nst lexicon into two parts, stdout for accepted lines, and stderr for skipped.
The accepted should compile to fst, and maybe the skipped will too, if they are in their own file.

sh ~/git/marytts/hb/marytts-lts-lexicon_builder allophones.no.xml ./no_nst_ok.txt
(should convert to good lts, fst, and pos.fst files. These should be used in mary, first of all)

It still didn't work (too many arc-labels). 
This command tries again from the *.dict, with more alignment iterations, and prints more output for error analysis:

sh ~/git/marytts/hb/lexToFst.sh ./no_nst_ok_lexicon.dict &> log

After a few iterations of skipping more words (convertNST2MaryTts.pl, marytts-lts-lexicon_builder, lexToFst.sh) this produced an fst that works (no_nst_ok_lexicon.fst).
test:
sh ~/git/marytts/hb/fst_lookup.sh ./no_nst_ok_lexicon.fst talesyntese


sh ~/git/marytts/hb/marytts-lts-lexicon_builder allophones.no.xml ./no_nst_skipped.txt
(should convert to fst, or if that fails, to dict. Use that as secondary lexicon)
It did fail to write fst. Ok so use the no_nst_skipped_lexicon.dict as secondary lexicon.

When that works, change the number if iterations in TranscriptionTableModel.java to that used in the working LexToFST.java, recompile, rerun.
sh ~/git/marytts/hb/marytts-lts-lexicon_builder allophones.no.xml ./no_nst_ok.txt
Now use the lts, fst, and pos.fst files in no.config.


Code to change:
JPhonemiser.java
allow list of fst or dict as lexiconProperty in no.config.
read fst or dict.
lookup in fst or dict (in order of lexiconProperty list)

Not quite done that way - easier change first:
added an optional secondary_lexicon property, and an optional lookup in that.

Ok so marytts-lang-no now has a working fst lexicon with 594606 entries, and a secondary lexicon with 43560 entries. Good.
One problem is that words with hyphen are not looked up in the lexica, they are first split. Lookup first, then split and try the parts. TODO

HB TODO
Rebuild the no_nst voices.
Do the Swedish and Danish nst lexica in the same way, and rebuild the voices.
